              The television industry has come far in terms of its technological developments 
              since the 1960s. One such development is the invention of the colored 
              television, which eventually replaced black-and-white television in the 
              1970s. Another development is cable television, which first appeared in 
              rural communities (Tucker, 2022). It then broadened its scope to reach 
              national programs and a diverse range of channels. The switch from analog 
              to digital television happened in 2009 which resulted in improved picture 
              quality while simultaneously freeing up the broadcasting spectrum. In the 
              next year, more than half of American residences had high-definition televisions 
              that provided an experience similar to the cinemas (Media and Culture, n.d.).

              Since the 1960s, the television industry has seen important technological 
              developments, such as the Color television which gained popularity in the 
              late 1960s, eventually replacing black-and-white television in the 1970s. 
              Another is Cable television, which initially emerged in the 1940s serving 
              rural communities (Tucker, 2022). This later expanded its reach to include 
              national programming and a diversified range of channels. Finally, the switch 
              from analog to digital television in 2009 enhanced picture quality and freed 
              up broadcasting spectrum. By 2010, over half of American homes had high-definition 
              televisions, offering a cinematic viewing experience (Media and Culture, n.d.).
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              Despite its dominance, the traditional television industry now faces a new challenge 
              as rapid advancements in Internet technology set the stage for a new era of content 
              consumption. The challenger, Netflix, capitalized on these technological changes, 
              introducing on-demand content that offered convenience and flexibility. Although 
              Netflix began as a DVD rental service in 1997 (Netflix, n.d.), it has since 
              grown to become a world leader in on-demand video streaming, radically changing 
              the way people watch media. As a result, it has developed into a disruptive 
              technology and becomes a serious threat to the established television industry.
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              It is because of such a situation that we would like to discuss Netflix and its 
              disruptive influence on the traditional television industry. This report 
              shall include a thorough analysis of Netflix as a disruptive technology and 
              its impact on consumer viewing habits. It would also tackle the current 
              situation of traditional television networks and their feedback on streaming services, 
              particularly Netflix. The potential risks to media preservation caused by streaming 
              platforms’ digital-first approach are explored as well. However, the study is confined 
              to the examination of Netflix as a representative case disruption and does not contain 
              financial metrics or operational information of competing streaming platforms. 
              Ultimately, this report offers insights into the revolutionization of the television 
              industry caused by Netflix and its implications for the future of media consumption.

              Disruptive technologies are products of innovation, changing consumer behavior, 
              business processes, and industries’ systems (Smith, 2022). The term “Disruptive 
              Technology” was coined by the late Clayton Christensen– a Professor in Business 
              Administration and an author– in 1995. He developed the theory of disruptive innovation, 
              which is introducing a product or service to a particular target market that 
              eventually “disrupts” the mainstream market (Christensen et al., 2015). 
              This theory explains how to produce disruptive technologies and when a 
              technology becomes disruptive.

            <p class="storyline">
              Professor Christensen further expounded this theory in his 
              book “The Innovation Dilemma”. According to him, there are 
              two kinds of technologies: disruptive and sustaining (Christensen, 2016).
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              Sustaining technologies focus on growing existing technologies from 
              established businesses. This technology relies on innovating by 
              enhancing features of current technologies without completely changing 
              them. For instance, Facebook, an established social media platform, 
              effectively maintains its relevance by consistently updating its 
              features and functionality for over two decades. Thus, its innovations 
              would be regarded as sustainable technologies.
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              On the other hand, disruptive technologies are innovations that change the 
              landscape of an industry or even entirely make a new one. These 
              technologies develop new systems for a new class of target audience. 
              One notable example of a disruptive technology is phone banking. 
              Online banking companies such as G-Cash and Maya started to emerge, 
              creating a new mode of payment other than cards and cash. This 
              technology changes the landscape of financial services and transactions.
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              Some technologies that are considered common today were once disruptive 
              technologies. Televisions, the internet, and cars were once regarded as 
              disruptive technologies. Television drastically changed the entertainment 
              industry, the internet altered the flow of information, and cars enhanced the mode 
              of transportation. These innovations that currently rely on sustainable 
              technologies were formerly disruptive when they were developed.
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              Nowadays, many start-ups actively attempt to build a disruptive technology 
              that will challenge the mainstream market in their respective niches. 
              While not all businesses succeed, some technologies still manage to 
              create a disruptive innovation–especially in digital media– such as 
              TikTok for social media, ChatGPT for AI, and Netflix for the film industry.

              Netflix continued to evolve and by 2013, they ventured into 
              original content production. The streaming platform transitioned 
              from a distributor into a creator of original entertainment with the 
              release of House of Cards, its first major success. It started to 
              create high-quality TV series and movies, breaking the mold of 
              traditional networks that relied on outside studios. Hits like Stranger 
              Things and The Crown soon followed, showing that Netflix was here to 
              stay—not just as a streaming platform, but as a major content creator,

              streaming platforms and studios, offering a diverse catalog 
              of content tailored to a worldwide audience. Netflix’s 
              journey from being a DVD rental into being a powerhouse 
              in the entertainment industry highlights utmost innovation 
              and adaptability, especially in a field considered highly 
              competitive. Several standout features made Netflix the 
              success and fan-favorite streaming platform it is now:
            </p>

            <ul>
              
            <li class="storyline">
              - On-Demand Streaming: Unlike traditional TV, Netflix puts its viewers in control 
              as they are free to watch content whenever they please without the need 
              to wait for a certain time or date to catch the next episode of a show. 
              The audience is also given the liberty to choose films they want to 
              watch rather than viewing whatever movie is currently on air.
            </li>

            <li class="storyline">
              - Personalized Recommendations: Netflix’s algorithm tailors 
              recommendations of shows or movies based on what an individual 
              has already viewed. This allows said individual to discover new 
              content that aligns with their personal preference.
            </li>

            <li class="storyline">
              - Original Content: Netflix has become known for its original programming, 
              other features. They allot a massive budget for the creation of 
              original content, whether it be shows or films, that can further 
              solidify their standing as a studio capable of competing with other 
              film studios and television channels. Content like Rebel Moon and 
              Stranger Things are only some of their original programs.
            </li>

            <li class="storyline">
              - Access on Multiple Devices: Netflix’s compatibility with various devices 
              ensures a seamless viewing experience and that viewers can easily 
              switch between gadgets, whether it be a smart TV, laptop, or smartphone, 
              without losing progress of where they’ve left off.
            </li>

            <li class="storyline">
              - Minimal Ads: Regardless of the variety in terms of plan offers, 
              Netflix’s subscription-based model grants ad-free viewing to most 
              users.
            </li>

            </ul>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              Netflix offers several subscription options to cater to different viewing 
              habits and budgets. The Basic plan (249 PHP / month) lets you stream on one 
              device at a time in standard definition. The Standard plan (399 PHP / month) 
              allows two simultaneous streams in HD, while the Premium plan (549 PHP / month) 
              offers 4K streaming on up to four devices at once (Netfix, n.d.). In 2022, 
              Netflix introduced an Ad-Supported plan for those who want to save a little 
              money while watching ads during their content. Unlike traditional TV, which 
              often requires expensive cable packages bundled with channels you might not 
              want, Netflix lets you pick the plan that suits your needs without locking you 
              into long-term contracts. You can cancel or change your plan whenever you want, 
              giving you much more flexibility than traditional television services.
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              The experience of consuming and delivering entertainment media is 
              the most notable distinction between Netflix and traditional television. 
              While the latter relies on scheduled programming, Netflix gives its viewers 
              the chance to watch all their available content anytime, anywhere.
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              Pricing is another notable difference between the two. While 
              traditional TV requires a viewer to subscribe to a cable bundled with 
              numerous channels, some of which are often unwatched, Netflix offers a 
              more straightforward subscription model that doesn’t discuss long-term 
              commitments. Moreover, traditional networks rely on advertisements for 
              revenue whereas the streaming platform highlights their ad-free plan 
              along with their lower-cost ad-supported plan.
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              While traditional television guarantees multiple shows and films at 
              one’s disposal as well, there’s no guarantee that what the viewer 
              is watching is their preference because they aren’t given the liberty 
              to choose their content. On the other hand, Netflix’s content library 
              is also vast, with numerous movies, documentaries, and TV series—including 
              original programming—available on-demand.

            <p class="storyline">
              Before the emergence of internet streaming services like Netflix, 
              traditional television was the typical entertainment source for most 
              households (Andrews, 2021). Programming schedules determine when a viewer 
              can watch their favorite show, requiring them to adjust their daily 
              schedules. Cable TV is accessed through a large variety of channels, 
              but the diversity is narrowed down due to the regional broadcasting 
              rights and time slots. With advertising revenue, networks could survive 
              on the income from commercials inserted throughout programming. Such a model 
              functioned for a multitude of years, yet it heavily assumed audiences would 
              remain rigid in their viewing schedule and would not mind whenever an advertisement 
              interrupted a show or program.

              However, there is more to the challenge that awaits the old television industry 
              than the competition posed by streaming services like Netflix. Cable subscriptions 
              have been dropping in a phenomenon that has come to be known as "cord-cutting" 
              whereby the younger generation of consumers are cutting it off in favor of cheaper 
              internet-based alternatives. Media globalization also presents a challenge, as 
              audiences can now easily enjoy international content, which can be full of fresh perspectives 
              and storytelling styles. Moreover, viewers have grown to dislike ads and consume media only 
              as part of an unbroken experience. Today, with audiences segmented across many 
              platforms, it is even harder for the old traditional TV networks to garner 
              those big monolithic audiences than they used to be.
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              In the past few years, viewer behaviors and preferences have 
              shifted significantly (Martlenz, n.d.). The binge-watching pattern has 
              become prevalent, as the audience prefers to watch the whole series at once 
              rather than waiting for episodic releases over a week. International dramas, 
              true crime documentaries, and independent films are in high demand as well, 
              especially for their diversity and quality. This is an aspect that streaming 
              platforms excel in that traditional television struggles with because they 
              are prone to target wider, less specific segments of audiences. Moreover, 
              the increased use of devices for viewing has also contributed to the changes 
              in behavior and preferences. Nowadays, televisions are mostly used for family viewing 
              or live sports while individuals tend to watch on their gadgets out of portability 
              and convenience.
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              Flexibility is another factor in shift from the traditional television (Sandry, 2024). Audiences no longer want strict programming schedules and instead enjoy content at their convenience and on their schedule. Because of these features, including ad-free service and recommendation of content specific to individual viewers, platforms such as Netflix succeed. These offerings align perfectly with the needs of today’s viewers, making Netflix and similar platforms increasingly in demand.
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              The revamped tastes of viewers pose significant challenges to models anchored on traditional television. Such networks are struggling to meet the modern demands of audiences in terms of on-demand viewing, minimal congestion, and compatibility across devices when such competition is streaming platforms, which in this case is Netflix. Considering that expectations continue to evolve, traditional television’s best route is to turn to innovation so as not to face irrelevance in a rapidly transforming entertainment field.

              The popularity of streaming platforms, including Netflix, contributed to the disruption of the traditional television industry, giving way to a new era of media consumption, and one such effect is that cable subscriptions have now declined. Most viewers canceled their cable subscriptions in favor of the more affordable, more flexible options available on streaming platforms such as Netflix (Al Jazeera, 2024). Because of such a significant demand for streaming, it’s become a struggle for cable providers to raise revenues and customer base. This shift in viewer behavior has forced traditional television providers to adapt their business models to remain competitive in the evolving media landscape (Sanusi & Ola, 2023).

            <p class="storyline">
              One of the ways traditional television networks have adapted is by launching their own streaming services. Peacock, Disney+, and Max (formerly HBO Max) are the platforms major film companies such as NBCUniversal, Disney, and Warner Media introduced respectively in an attempt to compete in the market. They offer similar services to Netflix in terms of a library while simultaneously trying to maintain a brand identity of their own and content control over their original programming.
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              Netflix continues to be a dominant force in the industry despite the competition, however. What the other streaming platforms offers are first provided by Netflix in the first place, whether it be a vast selection of movies and television shows, accessibility in multiple devices, or personalized experience—not just in recommendations but also in viewing settings (e.g. video quality, subtitles, and audio tracks). This remains a permanent reminder that on-demand viewing is how Netflix forever changed how content is made, marketed, delivered to, and consumed by audiences.
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              Another way Netflix impacted the traditional television industry is through bypassing traditional distribution channels. The company applied a direct-to-consumer model, which allowed both parties to build a direct relationship. This, in turn, allowed the streaming platform to garner valuable data on the viewer’s preferences and usage patterns (Guadiana, 2020). This is significantly valuable in the process of content production since this ensures the company that what they are creating has an audience that will watch. Furthermore, it is because of this model that the platform managed to create shows that fostered the popularity of the binge-watching culture, where finished seasons of a series are released at once, enabling viewers to consume content in one-sitting, almost as if on a marathon (Boulgaz, 2022).

              Geography plays an integral role in terms of accessing digital resources, especially if efforts are toward making it more seamless and widespread. Netflix appeals more to an individual equipped with gadgets and high-speed internet at their disposal, displaying the benefits of accessibility and portability. Subscription video-on-demand services (SODs), which is what Netflix offers, significantly transformed the competitive market in transnational video distribution. As a result, content is now allowed for sharing across borders without the limitations of regional licensing agreements (Lotz, 2020). It is because of the company’s direct-to-consumer model and cloud computing that it is enabled to bypass traditional distribution channels in a way that cables and satellite TVs couldn’t. As such, the need for intermediaries has been limited and content delivery improved.

              Because of Netflix’s availability in over 190 nations, it is considered the world’s leading internet entertainment service, with 283 million paid memberships (Netflix, 2024). An issue faced by the streaming platform, however, is internet connectivity issues posed by unreliable infrastructures and socioeconomic barriers in rural areas. Netflix continues to be the most-streamed entertainment service regardless of these challenges though because they enforce solutions to such issues effectively, such as offering various subscription plans to target lower-income brackets and partnering with regional internet service providers (ISPs) in an effort to build better infrastructures and increase internet penetration. For instance, in 2022, Netflix announced its Open Connect initiative, which involved installing content caching servers in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) (Volmer, 2022).

              Changes in lifestyle and advancements in technology are influencing customer preferences. In today's fast-paced society, busy lifestyles have become increasingly common. For instance, the leading Filipino television series of 2023 and 2024, including “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “Pulang Araw,” “Lavender Fields,” and “Maria Clara at Ibarra,” are now available for streaming on Netflix. This allows audiences to binge-watch their favorite shows at their convenience, without missing any episodes aired on Philippine television each night.

              A notable feature of Netflix is that not only does it put TV series on the platform, but it also operates data analytics to give tailored recommendations. This only proves that the company is utilizing a significant advancement in technology that can transform consumer preferences. Audiences can now select content based on their preferred location, language, and genre. Netflix utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze this data and predict what viewers may enjoy next. This process includes examining users’ behavior by analyzing their viewing history, browsing history, and ratings of different content. This personalized approach keeps users engaged and satisfied, stimulating Netflix to reach out to producers, studios, or distributors with similar content to its most-watched shows and movies to license their movies and shows for the platform.
            </p>
    
            <p class="storyline">
              This kind of strategy that Netflix is practicing by showcasing a variety of popular series and movies from other countries enables a growing interest in international content that introduces viewers to diverse cultures and perspectives.

              Despite the drop of traditional television due to the escalating popularity of streaming, it stays alive to be essential for elderly audiences with high spending power through showing live events such as news, sports, and entertainment, sustaining an average of viewing four hours daily (Cablefax, 2024). To stay competitive, many traditional broadcasters are implementing modern technologies such as interactive TV and personalized advertisements. But of course, many viewers prefer streaming platforms because of the idea that they can watch multiple episodes of TV programs in one sitting over a short period (Sanusi & Ola, 2023). Additionally, streaming platforms offer the ability to watch entertainment, news, and sports whenever you want to, anytime and from anywhere in the world.

              Before acknowledging the threat from streaming services like Netflix, traditional broadcasters are adopting streaming by partnering with popular platforms. Partnering with well-established services allows them to reach younger audiences and profit from older programs through content licensing agreements (Krizancic, 2023). These strategies endeavor to incorporate the adaptability and convenience of streaming with traditional benefits such as live programming.

              Traditional broadcast television has been dominated by the increasing number of streaming services like Netflix, which provides a more personalized, on-demand, and flexible viewing experience (Krizancic, 2023). However, amid these challenges, the experience of watching live TV broadcasts is still alive. Obviously the entertainment industry is going through a significant transformation as streaming services continue to evolve and grow in demand.

              Streaming services such as Netflix have streamlined the watching experience for the average viewer: a plethora of different series, movies, and documentaries all on a single platform that’s curated to your taste. Catalogs allow you to search media up by specific genres, while you could personally press “like” on a certain media to let the algorithm know that you like this specific kind of movie and will recommend you things related to it. However, as you use the service, you’ll find a tag on some movies saying that it’ll be available up until a certain time or it’ll be removed at a certain date. Once that media is gone from Netflix, what now?

              The rise of streaming services has indeed made consumption of media much more readily available, but as Kelly (2022) says, it only exacerbates the ephemerality of media in the digital age, leading to what is known as the “digital dark age.” The digital dark age, as coined by Kuny (1997), is considered an age where media stored digitally is much more temporary compared to its analogue counterparts. Though it’s agreed upon that streaming services have a large library of content ranging from vintage to recent, content can be removed from the platform with little to no notice thanks to a plethora of reasons such as a license expiring, a new license being formed with another streaming service, or for apparently no reason at all, as seen with the sudden removal of Cartoon Network shows from HBO Max back in 2022 (Larrimore, 2024).
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              Once a piece of media is taken off from a certain streaming service such as Netflix, there’s a chance it might reappear in another streaming service thanks to a new license. This, however, leads to the consumer to subscribe to yet another streaming service, an added expense, on top of the one they’re already using just to rewatch it—and that’s the best case scenario. Some content, such as originals produced for the streaming services, may simply disappear for good when it’s removed, while other content might never even make it into streaming services to begin with thanks to ownership and licensing issues. An example one can look to is Looking for Mr. Goodbar, a 1977 movie with no legal way to stream it thanks to an issue with its music rights.

              Physical media such as DVDs still exist and they are still used to preserve media, but they are most commonly purchased by people who intend to keep them as collections in this modern era. In addition, the average price of a DVD is around 44 USD (2600 PHP) per disc, which contributes to its rarity considering that a person can purchase a streaming service for less than half its price (Holder, 2024). As a result, physical media stores in North America began announcing bankruptcy, with big names such as Best Buy even announcing their cease of sales of DVDs last October 2023 (Spangler, 2023). Due to the rise of streaming services paired with their cheaper price, the popularity of physical media suffered a great decline.

              In 2017, Netflix released an adventure show titled Puss in Book: Trap in an Epic Tale where they first launched their interactive fiction feature. Initially, their target audience was children, but then they saw its potential and began targeting adult viewers with the show Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. This feature lets users control how the characters in the show respond, influencing the flow of the story. This becomes possible because of the crucial role that Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays. It eases the modification of a storyline's progress. Aside from AI, Virtual Reality (VR) was also introduced on Netflix years ago, around 2016, where users watched content on Netflix while being in a virtual environment, like a simulated living room. Experiments like this on streaming platforms prove how they are exploring new forms of engagement in the media and entertainment sector. Therefore, when these two technologies—AI and VR—are combined within content, it might not only alter the storyline, but it can also affect how users explore and internalize the flow of the story. Additionally, if Netflix converges these two within its platform, it might set them apart from their competitors in the industry, especially traditional television.

              Netflix has numerous competitors in the industry. There are niche platforms such as Disney+, Prime Video, Crunchyroll, etc., which cater to different user preferences, and these platforms continue to grow. They might threaten Netflix's user loyalty if Netflix doesn't consider more hyper-personalized recommendations powered by AI and better localization of content. Additionally, the globalization of content that Netflix has been doing might be one of the trends that helped them expand their global subscriber base, setting them apart from regional television networks. Netflix continues to target both global and local audiences. Another trend that Netflix might need to consider is applying green practices within their platform. They could attract environmentally conscious individuals by marketing eco-friendly sustainable efforts, especially since traditional television has been criticized for wasteful energy practices.
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              Despite these advantages of streaming platforms like Netflix, there are still things where they are less competitive compared to traditional televisions—live events. These kinds of live shows might be the strongest advantage television has, as it offers a real-time experience of events like sports and news. This keeps traditional TV networks relevant even up to these days. Older generations might also prefer and remain loyal to traditional television because it offers simplicity and familiarity. However, younger generations prefer digital streaming services, which challenges the traditional television industry to adapt to younger audiences' preferences unless they upgrade their delivery model. If not, their relevance across almost all generations might decline, causing them to play a smaller role in the broader entertainment industry. However, if they collaborate with streaming platforms, it might help them reach a wider scope of viewers.
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              Opportunities and risks are inevitable, and streaming platforms such as Netflix experience them too. One opportunity they might adapt to in the future is enhancing creativity with content formats. Pushing the limits of how storytelling is performed may attract younger generations, particularly tech-savvy ones, which could set them further apart from competitors, especially the traditional television industry. Experimenting with formats can be an advantage to gain more loyal viewers.
            </p>

            <p class="storyline">
              On the other hand, with the rise of many streaming platforms, consumers might feel overwhelmed since not all content can be watched or accessed on a single platform. Netflix might need to compete harder than usual, as there’s a possibility their users could switch to cheaper yet quality streaming platforms offering free ad-supported services. To address this, Netflix might need to apply marketing strategies like discounts or create exclusive content that piques viewers' interest.

              Today, Netflix has taken the world by storm. Due to the convenience of its services and their exclusive quality media productions and/or content, its popularity is increasing by the minute – new subscribers keep coming. In some households, it even has become a staple, a necessity – it has its share of the monthly budget, just like water, electric, and internet bills. Given these reasons, there’s no doubt that Netflix and similar streaming platforms disrupted and are currently disrupting the balance in the world of media.

              Although it has its pros, with convenience as its main desirable aspect (streaming anytime, anywhere), it has been mentioned that its downside includes the “expiry” or removal of some of the content in their platform after some time. If one of their exclusive contents gets removed or becomes unavailable on their platform, there won’t be any legal way to view that content any longer, unless it has been bought or licensed by another platform. Furthermore, Netflix currently doesn’t offer any live streaming service that television and other platforms such as YouTube and Facebook have. However, Netflix might address these weaknesses in the future, or if they move too slowly, they can be overtaken by another technology that would be developed in the future.

              Our world, both physical and digital/virtual, has its life cycle. The old gets replaced by the new, and only a few get to withstand the test of time due to its “timelessness” or by gaining loyal audiences or customers. To survive, it is essential to adapt, evolve, and learn to address the weaknesses of a product, service, or technology. What we may know today as disruptors will eventually become the norm, and there will be a rise of newer technologies that will then become the new “disruptors.”
